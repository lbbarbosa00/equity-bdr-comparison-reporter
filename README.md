# Comparative Analysis: Stock vs. BDR with Automated Reporting

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Project Status: Under Development

This repository contains the code and documentation for a data analysis project focused on comparing the performance, correlation, and volatility between a foreign-listed stock and its corresponding BDR (Brazilian Depositary Receipt) traded on the B3 exchange.

-----

### üéØ Objective

The goal is to create a Python script that takes the tickers of a stock and its BDR, performs a complete quantitative analysis, and consolidates the results into an automatically generated, professional PDF report, facilitating data-driven decision-making for investors.

-----

### ‚ú® Planned Features

  - [ ] **Dynamic Data Collection:** Automatically fetch historical price data via APIs (e.g., `yfinance`).
  - [ ] **Quantitative Analysis:** Calculate and compare key metrics such as cumulative returns, historical volatility (standard deviation of returns), and rolling correlations.
  - [ ] **Data Visualization:** Generate clear and insightful charts, including normalized price series, return distributions, and rolling correlation plots.
  - [ ] **Automated PDF Report Generation:** Consolidate all analyses and charts into a clean, easy-to-read PDF report.
